# ToDo-List
This is a simple ToDo application built by using react.js. Through this application, I learnt about the basic functioning of react, the usefulness and popularity of react in frontend development, about DOM and Virtual DOM, how to make components in react etc.
This Todo application lets the user add and delete tasks in a list. The user needs to type the task in the dialogue box and click on the  add button to add an entry. To delete an entry, the user just needs to click on that particular task to be deleted and that task will be removed.
